Search Engines reward websites that offer excellent user experience and valuable content. Proper **SEO **ensures your website can be found by the most people possible in search engines for words and phrases about what your site offers. Search engines such as Google and Bing display sites that are authoritative and relevant. They measure this relevance by analyzing each page for content and measure authority based on the number and quality of other pages linking to the pages they show. Simply put, SEO entails crafting content on pages that use keywords, phrases, topics and terms people use in their searches as well as links from other websites, blogs, articles, and media platforms.
