Content is the main fuel and backbone of the entire marketing process.Targeted, thoughtful and measurable social media marketing is a powerful tool that empowers brands to publish their content, foster and nurture relationships build rapport and develop loyal customers.

Yes, it is true SEO helps ensure your website continually reaches more and more views in order to reach your targeted market. However, the planet is filled with people who are using social media to share, connect, learn, inspire experience, sell and purchase products online. Building your audience also takes investing in creating and sharing quality content and having conversations in order to build genuine connections

Marketing to the masses is a thing of the past. The world has moved decisively away from the driven, "tell customers what to do and think" push style marketing in previous decades. Because of the increasing relationship based business structures within the thought-leading Fortune 100 (think "Google"), a new marketing model has emerged: invitational, "attraction-based" or pull style marketing.

The most basic premise of attraction-based marketing is having your products/services readily available as people discover you through organic searches and social engagement. With that said, the power of successful conversion rests in 3 arenas:

1. Ensuring your products/services are some of the first ones your niche markets see when they are searching for solutions to their issues.
2. Encouraging potential market members to search for your products
3. Establishing your business as a trusted, approachable authority in the places (forums, niche groups etc.) where your customer's clients, customers, and potential customers congregate.

Traditional marketing has gone social and has many moving parts. It is all about the power of relationships and integrating online strategic website development, branding with targeted social media reach which creates a solid foundation and new sources of value for your business. Good marketing is about telling a story and creating engaging ways for people to invest emotionally in your products or services.
