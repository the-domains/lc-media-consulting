> **Design: **Think of design like fashion. Not everyone has a sense for it, but trust us, it matters. You wouldn't want yourself going out in public looking bad, so why would you be okay with sending  your company out like that? When your business looks good,  you reap the rewards. 

> **Web Development:** With people spending both more time and money online then ever before, now is the time to have a great online presence. Your main store front is not longer brick and mortar, it's your website. Make sure it looks and functions great!
